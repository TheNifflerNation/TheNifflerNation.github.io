            The final round of the Up & Go Games was recently held outside the library. It consisted of a Choccy Milk
            Chugdown between Tom Hughes and Finnley Rimmel. Although Tom Hughes was the first to down his Choccy Milk.
            Tom's win is in dispute as it is alleged he spilt a significant amount of milk.
            A documentary will be released at a later date followed by a referendum to determine who won the 2021 Up &
            Go Games.
